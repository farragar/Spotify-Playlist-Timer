This app is currently *VERY* work-in-progress.

Source (scripts.js) is a proof-of-concept algorithm. It works, it's fast, and it's accurate (+/-2 seconds, based on my ~4k tracks playlist).

BUT: No real frontend, & code is messy.


TODO: 
Make a frontend!
Clean up code
Use absolute values when testing distance from optimal
